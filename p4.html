BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Reconfigurable logic computer architectures are computing systems which are capable of achieving very high levels of performance. Reconfigurable systems are based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), which are integrated circuits that consist of an array of programmable logic and programmable interconnect elements. The elements can be configured and reconfigured by the end user to implement a wide range of logic functions and digital circuits. FPGA-based systems use the FPGAs to implement custom algorithm-specific circuits that accelerate the execution of the algorithm. FPGA systems are highly efficient because the same circuit elements used for executing one algorithm can be reconfigured to execute a completely different and unrelated algorithm.

SRAM (static random access memory)-based FPGAs consist of logic and interconnection resources that are configured by program data stored in internal SRAM cells. The same FPGA components can be reconfigured an unlimited number of times, thereby allowing the same component to implement many different functions.

Reconfigurable logic architectures use the FPGA as a core system component that is reconfigured to suit any algorithm. High levels of performance are achieved because the gate-level customizations made possible with FPGAs results in an extremely efficient circuit organization that uses customized data-paths and "hardwired" control structures. These circuits exhibit significant fine-grained, gate-level parallelism that is not achievable with programmable, instruction-based technologies such as micro-processors or supercomputers. This makes such architectures especially well suited to applications requiring the execution of multiple computations during the processing of a large amount of data.

A basic reconfigurable system consists of two elements: a reconfigurable circuit resource of sufficient size and complexity, and a library of circuit descriptions (configurations) that can be down-loaded into the resource to configure it. The reconfigurable resource would consist of a uniform array of orthogonal logic elements (general-purpose elements with no fixed functionality) that would be capable of being configured to implement any desired digital function. The configuration library would contain the basic logic and interconnect primitives that could be used to create larger and more complex circuit descriptions. The circuit descriptions in the library could also include more complex structures such as counters, multiplexers, small memories, and even structures such as controllers, large memories and microcontroller cores.
